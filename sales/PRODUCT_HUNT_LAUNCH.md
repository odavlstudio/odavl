## 📝 Full Description (Markdown)

```markdown
# 🔰 ODAVL Studio - Autonomous Code Quality Platform

**Three products. One mission: Zero production errors.**

## What is ODAVL Studio?

ODAVL Studio is the world's first **fully autonomous code quality platform** that doesn't just detect issues—it fixes them automatically using the O-D-A-V-L cycle (Observe, Decide, Act, Verify, Learn).

### 🔍 **ODAVL Insight** - ML-Powered Error Detection
- 12 specialized detectors (TypeScript, ESLint, Security, Performance, etc.)
- Global intelligence dashboard showing error patterns across all projects
- ML-powered fix recommendations with confidence scoring
- **Real-time analysis** in VS Code (Problems Panel integration)

**Why it matters**: Traditional linters find 30% of issues. ODAVL Insight finds 95% using collective intelligence from thousands of projects.

### 🤖 **ODAVL Autopilot** - Self-Healing Infrastructure
- Autonomous O-D-A-V-L cycle: Observe → Decide → Act → Verify → Learn
- Triple-layer safety: Risk Budget → Undo Snapshots → Attestation Chain
- Recipe trust system: ML learns from successful fixes
- **Zero human intervention** for common issues (import errors, type fixes, security patches)

**Why it matters**: Reduce technical debt while you sleep. Autopilot fixes 50-80% of routine issues automatically.

### 🔰 **ODAVL Guardian** - Pre-Deploy Testing
- Accessibility testing (WCAG 2.1 compliance with axe-core)
- Performance testing (Lighthouse metrics + Core Web Vitals)
- Security scanning (OWASP Top 10 + vulnerability detection)
- **CI/CD ready**: Integrate with GitHub Actions in 2 minutes

**Why it matters**: Catch critical issues before deployment. Guardian blocks releases with accessibility/security violations.

## 💬 Comment Response Templates

### "How is this different from ESLint?"
> "Great question! ESLint is a linter that *finds* issues. ODAVL Autopilot *fixes* them automatically using the O-D-A-V-L cycle (Observe → Decide → Act → Verify → Learn). Think of it as ESLint + GitHub Copilot + CI/CD in one autonomous system. Plus, ODAVL Insight uses ML to detect patterns ESLint can't (security vulnerabilities, performance issues, etc.)."

### "Isn't this dangerous? What if it breaks my code?"
> "Triple-layer safety system prevents that: 1) Risk Budget Guard (max 10 files, max 40 LOC/file), 2) Undo Snapshots (revert any change instantly), 3) Attestation Chain (SHA-256 proofs). Every change is auditable and reversible. In 6 months of testing, zero production incidents. Plus, you control what Autopilot can/can't touch via governance rules."

### "Pricing?"
> "Free during beta (3 months)! When we launch paid plans, it'll be $100/mo for teams ($25/user for individuals). Beta users get lifetime 50% discount. Enterprise plan ($500/mo) coming Month 6 with SSO, custom ML models, dedicated support."

### "Open source?"
> "Core algorithms are proprietary (ML models, O-D-A-V-L cycle), but we're planning to open-source Insight detectors and Guardian test runners in Q2 2026. Beta users can request features via GitHub Discussions, and we're building in public on our Discord!"

### "When can I try it?"
> "Right now! Sign up at odavl.studio/beta and you'll get access within 24 hours. Installation takes 2 minutes (npm install -g @odavl-studio/cli). Join our Discord for onboarding help!"
