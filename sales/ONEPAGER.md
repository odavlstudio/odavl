# ODAVL Studio - Autonomous Code Quality System

![ODAVL Logo](assets/logo-placeholder.png)

## 🚨 The Problem: Code Quality Debt is Killing Productivity

- **Manual Code Reviews**: 40% of PR time spent on lint fixes and style issues
- **Flaky Builds**: TypeScript errors and ESLint warnings cause CI failures  
- **Security Risk**: CVEs accumulate faster than teams can address them
- **Developer Frustration**: Endless technical debt slows feature development

*Your developers should build features, not fix lint warnings.*

## ✨ ODAVL Studio: Your Autonomous Code Doctor

**Enterprise-grade AI system that continuously improves code quality while you sleep.**

🔄 **How It Works** (Observe → Decide → Act → Verify → Learn):

- **Observe**: Monitor ESLint warnings, TypeScript errors, and security vulnerabilities  
- **Decide**: AI selects optimal fixes using learned trust patterns from your team
- **Act**: Apply automated improvements (eslint --fix, import cleanup, type fixes)
- **Verify**: Safety gates ensure zero breaking changes reach production
- **Learn**: Build team-specific improvement recipes with cryptographic attestation

---

## 🛡️ Enterprise Safety First

- **Risk Budget**: Never touch >5 files or >40 lines per change
- **Protected Paths**: Configure untouchable directories (tests, configs, public APIs)
- **Shadow Verify**: Test changes in isolation before applying
- **Auto-Undo**: Instant rollback if any quality metric degrades
- **Attestation**: Cryptographic proof of every successful improvement

*"Deploy with confidence. ODAVL has never caused a production incident."*
