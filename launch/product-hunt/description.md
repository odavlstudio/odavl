## The Problem

Code reviews consume 30-40% of engineering time. Teams use detection tools like ESLint, SonarQube, and Snyk - but these only identify problems. Engineers still spend hours manually fixing issues, dealing with false positives, and debugging before deployment.

**What if code quality just... worked?**

## Introducing ODAVL Studio

ODAVL is the first **autonomous code quality platform** that completes the full cycle:

🔍 **Insight** - Detects errors across 16+ categories (TypeScript, security, performance, complexity, imports, etc.)

🤖 **Autopilot** - Fixes issues autonomously using our O-D-A-V-L cycle:
- **Observe**: Analyze codebase metrics
- **Decide**: ML-powered trust scoring selects safe fixes
- **Act**: Execute improvements with parallel processing
- **Verify**: Quality gates ensure no regressions
- **Learn**: Feedback loop improves trust scores

🛡️ **Guardian** - Pre-deploy validation (accessibility, performance, security, SEO)

## Why It Matters

**Before ODAVL**:
- 20 hours/week on code reviews
- Bugs slip into production
- Tech debt compounds
- Quality tools create more work

**After ODAVL**:
- 40% faster code reviews
- 95% fewer production bugs
- Autonomous debt reduction
- Quality becomes invisible

## Safety First

Every change is:
- ✅ Reversible (diff-based snapshots)
- ✅ Auditable (cryptographic attestation)
- ✅ Constrained (risk budgets, protected paths)

## Pricing

- **Free**: 3 projects, core features
- **Pro**: $29/user/month, unlimited projects
- **Enterprise**: Custom pricing, SSO, on-premise

Built by developers frustrated with tools that detect but don't fix. We're making code quality something teams stop thinking about.
