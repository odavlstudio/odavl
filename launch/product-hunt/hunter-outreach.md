Hi [Hunter Name],

I'm [Your Name], founder of ODAVL Studio - an autonomous code quality platform that detects, fixes, and validates code issues.

We're launching on Product Hunt on **March 15, 2025** and would love for you to be our hunter.

**Why ODAVL is interesting**:
- First platform to complete full cycle (detect → fix → validate)
- ML-powered trust scoring for safe autonomous fixes
- 8 design partners with 40% faster code reviews
- Built by ex-[Company] engineers frustrated with existing tools

**What I've prepared**:
- 60-second demo video
- 8 screenshots with captions
- First comment (300 words)
- Community mobilization plan (email list, partners, Slack/Discord)

**What I'm asking**:
- Hunt us on March 15 at 12:01 AM PST
- Optional: Share with your network during launch day

**Why you?**
[Personalize: mention a product they hunted that you admire, or why their audience is perfect fit]

Happy to jump on a 15-min call to discuss, or send over assets for review.

Thanks for considering!
