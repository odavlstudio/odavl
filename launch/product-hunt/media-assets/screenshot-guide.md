## Screenshot Best Practices

### Before Capturing
- [ ] Use demo/staging environment (not production data)
- [ ] Clean up browser tabs, desktop icons
- [ ] Close unnecessary windows
- [ ] Set browser zoom to 100%
- [ ] Use large monitor (min 1920x1080)
- [ ] Hide sensitive data (names, emails, IPs)

### During Capture
- [ ] Use native screenshot tools (not phone photos)
- [ ] Windows: `Win + Shift + S`
- [ ] Mac: `Cmd + Shift + 4`
- [ ] Linux: `gnome-screenshot` or `flameshot`
- [ ] Capture full window (not just partial)

### After Capture
- [ ] Crop to remove excess whitespace
- [ ] Resize to consistent dimensions (1920x1080)
- [ ] Add subtle drop shadow (optional)
- [ ] Compress PNG (use TinyPNG or similar)
- [ ] Rename descriptively (insight-dashboard.png)
- [ ] Review on mobile (thumbnails must be clear)

## Annotation Tips (Optional)

### When to Annotate
- Highlighting specific feature
- Explaining complex UI element
- Drawing attention to key metric

### Annotation Tools
