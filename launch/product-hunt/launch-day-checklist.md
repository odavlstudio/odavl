## Emergency Responses

### "This looks like vaporware"
"We have 8 design partners using ODAVL in production. Happy to provide a live demo - DM me!"

### "Too expensive"
"Free tier covers 3 projects forever. Pro is $29/user/month - less than 1 hour of engineering time saved per month."

### "How is this different from SonarQube?"
"SonarQube detects issues. ODAVL detects AND fixes AND validates. It's the difference between a to-do list and an autonomous system."

### "Security concerns about auto-fixing"
"Every change is: 1) Reversible (snapshots), 2) Auditable (attestation chain), 3) Constrained (risk budgets). You have full control."

### "What languages?"
"Currently TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Java. Adding Go, Rust, Ruby, PHP, Swift, Kotlin in Q2 2025."
