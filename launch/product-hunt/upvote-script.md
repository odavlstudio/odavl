We're LIVE on @ProductHunt! 🚀

ODAVL Studio - autonomous code quality that detects, fixes, and validates.

40% faster code reviews
95% fewer bugs
AI-powered self-healing

Check it out: [PH link]

Thread on why we built this 👇
```

**Tweet 2**:
```
The problem: Code reviews consume 30-40% of engineering time.

Tools like ESLint only DETECT issues.
Engineers still manually FIX everything.

We asked: What if code quality just... worked?
```

**Tweet 3**:
```
ODAVL completes the full cycle:

🔍 Insight: Detects 16+ error types
🤖 Autopilot: Fixes autonomously with ML
🛡️ Guardian: Validates before deploy

It's like having a senior engineer on autopilot.
```

**Tweet 4**:
```
Safety first:
✅ Every change is reversible
✅ Cryptographic attestation
✅ Risk budgets prevent runaway fixes

You have full control. It just saves you time.
```

**Tweet 5**:
```
Design partners saw:
- 40% reduction in review time
- 12K lines of tech debt eliminated
- 3 months without production bugs

It works. Now we're sharing it.
```

**Tweet 6**:
```
Free tier available. No credit card.

## LinkedIn Post Script (Post at 9 AM Launch Day)

**Tone**: Professional, storytelling

After watching teams spend 30-40% of their time on code reviews for years, I built something different.

Today, we're launching ODAVL Studio on Product Hunt.

Unlike tools that only detect problems, ODAVL:
• Detects errors across 16+ categories
• Fixes issues autonomously with ML-powered trust scoring
• Validates deployments before production

Early results from design partners:
→ 40% reduction in code review time
→ 95% fewer bugs reaching production
→ 5.3x ROI in first month

Every change is reversible, auditable, and constrained. Safety isn't optional - it's built-in.

We're not just making code quality easier. We're making it autonomous.

🚀 Launch: https://producthunt.com/posts/odavl-studio

If you've ever felt buried by tech debt or spent hours in code review, I'd love your support and feedback.
