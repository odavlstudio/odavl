## Full Script (300s)

**[0-30s] Introduction**
"I'm [Name], founder of ODAVL Studio. Today I'll show you how we've solved the code quality problem - not just detection, but complete autonomous operation."

**[30-90s] The Problem**
"Traditional workflow: ESLint detects 200 issues. You manually fix each one. 8 hours later, still not done."
"SonarQube finds security issues. Creates tickets. Engineers prioritize, fix, test. Weeks pass."
"Even with automation, you're managing the automation. What if it just... worked?"

**[90-180s] ODAVL Solution - Live Demo**
*Run full cycle*
"Three products working together: Insight detects, Autopilot fixes, Guardian validates."
"Watch: I run one command. Insight scans 200 files in 3 seconds. Finds 47 issues."
"Autopilot decides which fixes are safe using ML trust scores. Executes 12 recipes in parallel."
"35 issues fixed automatically. Diff snapshots saved. Code improved."
"Guardian runs pre-deploy tests. Accessibility, performance, security. Score: 95%. Passed."
"Total time: 45 seconds. Manual time: 6 hours. 8x faster."

**[180-240s] Safety & Control**
"You're thinking: What if it breaks something?"
"Every change reversible - one-click undo. Cryptographic attestation for compliance."
"Risk budgets prevent runaway fixes - max 10 files per cycle."
"Protected paths - never touches auth/, security/, tests without approval."
"Quality gates - if tests fail, automatic rollback."

**[240-270s] Results**
"8 design partners, 6 months of data:"
"40% faster code reviews (20 hours → 12 hours/week)"
"95% fewer production bugs (issues caught pre-deploy)"
"5.3x ROI first month ($87/user generates $460 in time savings)"

**[270-300s] Next Steps**
"Three tiers: Free (3 projects), Pro ($29/user/month), Enterprise (custom)."
"Start free today - no credit card. Deploy in 5 minutes."
