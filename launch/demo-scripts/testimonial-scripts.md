## Testimonial #1: Startup CTO

**Name**: Jane Smith, CTO @ Acme Startup  
**Company**: 15 engineers, Series A

### Script (45s)

"I'm Jane Smith, CTO at Acme Startup.

Before ODAVL, our team spent 20 hours per week on code reviews - mostly hunting for bugs. With 15 engineers shipping fast, quality suffered.

ODAVL Autopilot now catches and fixes issues before they reach PR. Our reviews dropped to 12 hours per week - 40% faster.

In 3 months, we've eliminated 12,000 lines of technical debt and had zero production bugs. That's never happened before.

If you're a startup moving fast, ODAVL lets you keep velocity without sacrificing quality. Game changer."

## Testimonial #2: Enterprise Tech Lead

**Name**: John Doe, Tech Lead @ Beta Corp  
**Company**: 200+ engineers, Fortune 500

### Script (50s)

"I'm John Doe, Tech Lead at Beta Corporation.

With 200 engineers across 5 timezones, maintaining code standards was impossible. Every team did their own thing.

ODAVL Guardian enforces consistent quality gates across all deployments. Nothing reaches production without passing accessibility, performance, and security tests.

Since adopting ODAVL 6 months ago, our compliance audit scores went from 72% to 98%. Our legal team is thrilled.

For enterprise teams, ODAVL gives you governance without slowing down developers. It just works."

## Testimonial #3: Open Source Maintainer

**Name**: Sarah Johnson, Maintainer @ OpenProject  
**Company**: OSS project, 50 contributors

### Script (40s)

"I'm Sarah Johnson, I maintain OpenProject - an open source tool with 50 volunteer contributors.

Quality was all over the place. Some contributors are senior engineers, others are beginners. I spent 10 hours per week reviewing PRs.

ODAVL's free OSS tier auto-reviews every PR. It catches common mistakes, suggests fixes, and even adds them as comments.

My review time dropped to 3 hours per week. Contributors learn faster. Project quality improved.

If you maintain open source, ODAVL's OSS program is incredible. And it's free forever."
