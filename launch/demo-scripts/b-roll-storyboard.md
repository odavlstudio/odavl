## Shooting Original B-Roll

### Office Shots (If Available)
- [ ] Developer at desk (over shoulder)
- [ ] Team standup meeting
- [ ] Whiteboard brainstorming
- [ ] Coffee break chitchat
- [ ] Laptop with ODAVL dashboard

**Equipment**: iPhone is fine, stabilizer helps

### Screen Captures
- [ ] Cursor moving smoothly
- [ ] Click actions clearly visible
- [ ] Typing code (slow, deliberate)
- [ ] Terminal commands executing
- [ ] VS Code with ODAVL extension

**Tips**: 60fps, high resolution, zoom to 90%

---

## Integration Guidelines

### Timing
- B-roll clips: 2-5 seconds each
- Don't distract from main content
- Use during transitions or voiceover

### Transitions
- Fade: Simple, professional
- Slide: Directional flow
- Cut: Fast-paced energy
- Dissolve: Smooth blend

**Avoid**: Cheesy wipes, spinning cubes

### Color Grading
- Match brand colors (blue/purple tint)
- Slight saturation boost
- Consistent across all clips
- Test on multiple displays

---

## Assembly Order

1. **Record main demo** (priority)
2. **Edit rough cut** (structure only)
3. **Add voiceover** (sync with visuals)
4. **Identify gaps** (where B-roll helps)
5. **Source/create B-roll** (targeted)
6. **Insert B-roll** (enhance, not replace)
7. **Add music/SFX** (final polish)
8. **Color grade** (consistency)
9. **Export & test** (multiple devices)

## Example Timeline (60s video)

```
0:00-0:05   B-Roll: Frustrated developer
0:05-0:10   Screen: Dashboard overview
0:10-0:15   B-Roll: Error icons piling up
0:15-0:25   Screen: Insight detecting issues
0:25-0:30   B-Roll: Code before/after split
0:30-0:40   Screen: Autopilot fixing
0:40-0:45   B-Roll: Quality gate passing animation
0:45-0:50   Screen: Guardian validation
0:50-0:55   B-Roll: ROI calculator, team high-five
0:55-0:60   Screen: CTA with logo
```

Keep screen captures as primary content,  
B-roll as visual enhancement (20-30% of video)
