## Email Version B (Story-Driven)

**Subject**: After 18 months, we're ready to show you ODAVL

**Preview Text**: Autonomous code quality built from 10 years of developer frustration

**Body**:
```html
Hi,

I spent 10 years watching engineering teams waste 30-40% of their time on code reviews.

Tools that detect problems but don't fix them. Manual work that should be automated. Bugs that slip through despite hours of review.

Enough.

**Today, we launch ODAVL Studio.**

Three products working together:
• Insight: Detects errors (16+ categories, 95% accuracy)
• Autopilot: Fixes autonomously (ML-powered, 100% reversible)
• Guardian: Validates before deploy (quality gates, compliance)

**Real Results**:
"40% faster reviews. 12K LOC tech debt eliminated. 3 months without a single production bug."
— Jane Smith, CTO @ Acme Startup

**Launch Day Special**:
First 100 signups get:
✅ 30-day Pro trial (unlimited projects)
✅ $50 credit (stackable with referrals)
✅ Priority onboarding call

**Help Us Reach #1**:
We're launching on Product Hunt today. Your upvote makes a difference.

ODAVL Studio launches today on Product Hunt.

**The Problem (By the Numbers)**:

📊 30-40% of engineering time spent on code reviews [1]

| Tech debt | Growing | Shrinking | 12K LOC cleaned |
| ROI | — | 5.3x | Month 1 |
