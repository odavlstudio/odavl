ODAVL Studio - autonomous code quality that detects, fixes, and validates.

40% faster code reviews
95% fewer bugs
AI-powered self-healing

Check it out: [PH link]

Thread on why we built this 👇
```

**Tweet 2**
```
The problem: Code reviews consume 30-40% of engineering time.

Tools like ESLint only DETECT issues.
Engineers still manually FIX everything.

We asked: What if code quality just... worked?
```

**Tweet 3**
```
ODAVL completes the full cycle:

🔍 Insight: Detects 16+ error types
🤖 Autopilot: Fixes autonomously with ML
🛡️ Guardian: Validates before deploy

It's like having a senior engineer on autopilot.
```

**Tweet 4**
```
Safety first:
✅ Every change is reversible
✅ Cryptographic attestation
✅ Risk budgets prevent runaway fixes

You have full control. It just saves you time.
```

**Tweet 5**
```
Design partners saw:
→ 40% reduction in review time
→ 12K lines of tech debt eliminated
→ 3 months without production bugs

It works. Now we're sharing it.
```

**Tweet 6**
```
Three products, one platform:

Insight = The brain (detects everything)
Autopilot = The hands (fixes autonomously)
Guardian = The shield (validates before deploy)

Together, they eliminate code quality as a problem.
```

**Tweet 7**
```
Built for safety:
• Diff snapshots for instant rollback
• Protected paths (never touch auth/security)
• Quality gates (tests must pass)
• Trust scoring (only safe fixes execute)

Autonomous doesn't mean reckless.
```

Pricing:
🆓 Free: 3 projects, core features
💼 Pro: $29/user/month, unlimited projects
🏢 Enterprise: SSO, on-premise, custom SLA

Open Source Program: Free Pro forever for OSS maintainers
```

**Tweet 9**
```
Tech stack (for the curious):
• TypeScript monorepo (pnpm)
• TensorFlow.js for ML trust scoring
• Next.js 15 for dashboards
• Prisma + PostgreSQL
• VS Code extensions

160+ source files, 13K+ LOC.

**Insight Detector**
```
ODAVL Insight catches what other tools miss:

TypeScript errors (unused vars, any types)
Security issues (secrets, SQL injection)
Performance problems (sync ops, memory leaks)
Import cycles, circular dependencies

16 detectors. 95% accuracy. Real-time.

Try free: odavl.com/insight
```

**Autopilot O-D-A-V-L**
```
The O-D-A-V-L cycle:

Observe → Analyze codebase
Decide → ML picks safe fixes
Act → Execute in parallel
Verify → Quality gates check
Learn → Improve trust scores

Autonomous code improvement that actually works.

```

**Guardian Validation**
```
Guardian tests before you deploy:

✅ Accessibility (WCAG 2.1)
✅ Performance (Core Web Vitals)
✅ Security (OWASP Top 10)
✅ SEO (meta, structure)

Quality gates block bad deployments.

```

**VS Code Extension**
```
ODAVL in your IDE:

• Real-time issue detection
• Problems Panel integration
• One-click fix with Autopilot
• Ledger preview
• Auto-opens on file save

Native extension for seamless workflow.

Install: [marketplace link]
```

**ML Trust Scoring**
```
How does autonomous fixing stay safe?

ML trust predictor with 10 features:
→ Success rate history
→ Complexity analysis
→ File impact assessment
→ Consecutive failure tracking

Only recipes >0.8 trust execute automatically.
```

**Parallel Execution**
```
Autopilot v2.0 runs recipes in parallel:

Before: Sequential (4 min)
After: Parallel (60 seconds)

4x faster, same safety guarantees.

Dependency graph prevents file conflicts.
Smart worker pool (CPU cores / 2).
```

**Undo Snapshots**
```
Every ODAVL change is reversible:

Diff-based snapshots (85% smaller)
SHA-256 integrity checks
One-click rollback
Batch restore if failure

Autonomous with safety net.
```

**Quality Gates**
```
Quality gates = deployment guardrails:

Set thresholds per project
Block if tests fail
Enforce coverage minimums
Require passing security scans

No bugs reach production.
```

**Referral System**
```
ODAVL has viral growth built-in:

3 referrals = 1 month Pro free
10 referrals = 3 months Pro free
25 referrals = 1 year Pro free

Invite teammates, earn rewards.

**Question 1**
```
Poll: What's your biggest code quality pain point?

🐛 Too many bugs reaching production
⏰ Code reviews taking forever
📚 Technical debt piling up
🔍 Finding issues manually

Vote + reply with details 👇
```

**Question 2**
```
Hot take: Tools that only detect problems are part of the problem.

They create more work, not less.

Code quality needs autonomy, not more alerts.

Agree or disagree?
```

**Question 3**
```
Developers: Would you trust AI to fix your code autonomously?

✅ Yes, if changes are reversible
⚠️ Maybe, depends on what it fixes
