## Slide 2: The Problem (Pain Point)

### Engineering Teams Waste 20-30% of Time on Code Review

**The Reality:**
- 📊 **250+ open issues** in typical Series B codebase
- ⏱️ **2-3 days** average PR review time
- 💰 **$150K/year** wasted per 10-person team
- 😫 **Developer burnout** from repetitive work

**Current Solutions Fall Short:**
- ESLint: Detects issues but doesn't fix (0% auto-fix)
- SonarQube: Slow (8.7s analysis) + no auto-fix
- Manual review: Doesn't scale, inconsistent quality

**Market Size:**
- 27M developers worldwide
- 4M organizations on GitHub
- $18B code quality market (2025)
- Growing 23% CAGR

**Visual:** Split screen - Developer frustrated with 250 ESLint errors vs ODAVL fixing them in 2.3s
