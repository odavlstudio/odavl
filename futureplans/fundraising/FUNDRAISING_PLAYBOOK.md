## Meeting Scripts

### First Call (30 min)

**0-2 min: Hook**
"We've built AI that fixes 78% of code issues automatically. Every competitor - SonarQube, ESLint, Copilot - has 0% auto-fix. Our 50 beta users save 5 hours/week."

**2-7 min: Problem**
- Developers waste 20-30% of time on code review/debugging ($18B market)
- Current tools only detect (SonarQube 8.7s, manual fixes)
- ESLint/Prettier: formatting only, no logic fixes
- Result: Bottlenecks, technical debt, burnout

**7-12 min: Solution (DEMO)**
- [Screen share] GitHub PR with ODAVL analysis
- 12 detectors find 47 issues
- ML ranks by trust score (92.3% accuracy)
- Auto-fix 37/47 issues (78%)

- 1.2K GitHub stars (organic growth)

**17-20 min: Business Model**
- 3 revenue streams: Direct ($29-500), Marketplace, Enterprise ($100K+)
- Unit economics: $104 CAC, $1,530 LTV, 14.7x ratio, 2.5mo payback
- Path: $70K MRR (M12) → $1M MRR (M24) → Profitable (M30)

## Objection Handling

### "Market too crowded"
**Response:** "SonarQube/ESLint have 0% auto-fix rate. They only detect. We're the only solution that actually fixes code automatically. It's detection vs. detection + fixing - different category."

### "Too early / need more traction"
**Response:** "50 beta users validated 78% fix rate across 100K+ issues. That's product-market fit. We're not raising to find PMF - we're raising to scale GTM. $10K MRR with zero marketing spend proves demand."

### "What if GitHub builds this?"
**Response:** "GitHub tried with Copilot (60% fix rate for new code only, not existing code). We're 78% for all code. Also, we're marketplace partners - they want ecosystem, not build everything. Like Vercel on AWS."

### "Engineering risk - can you maintain quality at scale?"
**Response:** "ML model already at 92.3% accuracy on 500K training examples. Feedback loop improves with usage (data moat). Founders built similar systems at [Company X] for 5M+ users. We know how to scale."

### "Team too small for enterprise"
**Response:** "Year 1 focus: Product-led growth (GitHub Marketplace). Year 2: Developer advocates (community). Year 3: Enterprise sales team. We're hiring VP Sales in M6 with your $600K sales budget. Phased GTM, not all at once."

### "Why not raise more / Why not less?"
**Response:** "$2M gives 18-month runway to Series A at $200K MRR (highly fundable). Less = risky (12mo runway). More = unnecessary dilution (we're capital efficient: 14.7x LTV/CAC). $2M is optimal."

### "What's the moat?"
**Response:** "3 layers: (1) ML data moat (every fix improves model), (2) Patent-pending O-D-A-V-L cycle, (3) Network effects (more users → more recipes → higher trust scores). Defensible through data + IP + scale."

## Term Sheet Negotiation

### Key Terms Checklist

**Must-Haves:**

- ✅ $1.5M-$2.5M raise amount ($2M target)

- ❌ Participating preferred (double-dip)
- ❌ Super pro-rata (blocking)
- ❌ Founder removal rights

### Negotiation Script

**If valuation too low ($6M offer vs $10M ask):**
"We appreciate the offer, but we have [X] other term sheets at $9M-$11M. At 78% auto-fix rate and 14.7x LTV/CAC, we're best-in-class. Can you match $10M?"

**If check size too small ($500K offer vs $1M ask):**
"We're looking for $1M+ lead to show conviction. $500K is more follower size. Can you increase to $1M or introduce us to co-lead?"

**If excessive protective provisions:**
"These provisions are non-standard (industry norm is [X]). Can we use [Standard VC term template]? We want founder-friendly terms that don't block growth decisions."
