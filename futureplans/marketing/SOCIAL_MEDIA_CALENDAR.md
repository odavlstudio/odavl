## Week 23 Schedule (Nov 22-28)

### Monday, Nov 22
**Twitter 9 AM:** Product launch announcement
```
🚀 Launching ODAVL on Product Hunt next week!

AI that auto-fixes 78% of code issues (ESLint: 0%)

Early access: odavl.studio
PH link: [coming Dec 3]

RT to support! 🙏
```

**LinkedIn 10 AM:** Founder story
```
Why I built ODAVL:

At my last startup, our team spent 5+ hours/week manually fixing code issues that ESLint detected.

20-30% of dev time = wasted on grunt work.

So we built AI to automate it. Result: 78% auto-fix rate, 4.8/5 rating from 50 beta users.

Launching on Product Hunt Dec 3. Follow along: odavl.studio

Poll: How much time do you spend fixing code issues per week?

⚪ <1 hour (you're lucky)
⚪ 1-3 hours (typical)
⚪ 3-5 hours (ouch)
⚪ 5+ hours (we can help)

🧵 5 code quality tips that 99% of developers ignore:

1/ Use TypeScript strict mode
2/ Set up pre-commit hooks
3/ Automate fixes (not just detection)
4/ Review AI-generated code
5/ Measure tech debt weekly

**LinkedIn 10 AM:** Industry analysis
```
The $18B Code Quality Market (2024-2030):

Current leaders:
- SonarQube: $500M ARR, 0% auto-fix
- ESLint: Open source, 0% auto-fix
- GitHub Copilot: $100M ARR, 60% accuracy (generation only)

The gap: No one auto-fixes existing code at scale.

That's where ODAVL comes in: 78% auto-fix rate, ML-powered, 2.3s analysis.

We're raising $2M to capture this market.

Investors: DM for deck.

## Week 24 Schedule (Nov 29-Dec 5)

### Monday, Nov 29
**Twitter 9 AM:** Product Hunt countdown
```
4 days until Product Hunt launch! 🚀

What we're most excited about:
✅ Reaching 1M developers
✅ Proving 78% auto-fix works at scale
✅ Building the code quality future

Support us Dec 3: [PH link]

RT = huge help 🙏
```

**LinkedIn 10 AM:** Founder reflection
```
6 months ago: 0 users, 0 revenue, just an idea

Today: 1,566 users, $10K MRR, Product Hunt launch in 4 days

Key decisions that worked:
1. Solve your own problem (we used ODAVL internally first)
2. Launch early (MVP in 8 weeks, not 8 months)
3. Listen to users (50 beta testers shaped the product)
4. Focus on ONE metric (78% auto-fix rate)

Biggest lesson: Perfection is the enemy of shipped.

Launch next week. Follow our journey: odavl.studio

**LinkedIn 2 PM:** Founder story (emotional)
```
Tomorrow we launch on Product Hunt.

6 months ago, I was burnt out from code reviews at my startup. 30% of my time = grunt work.

So I built ODAVL to solve my own problem.

Today: 1,566 developers use it. They save 5 hours/week. $10K MRR proves people will pay for time back.

But the best part? Messages like:

"ODAVL gave me my evenings back. I can spend time with my kids now."

That's why we're building this.

Tomorrow, we take the next step.
