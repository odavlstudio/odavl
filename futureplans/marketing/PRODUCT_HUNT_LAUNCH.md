### Description (260 chars)
Tired of manual code fixes? ODAVL uses ML to automatically fix TypeScript/JavaScript issues - 78% success rate vs 0% for ESLint/SonarQube. GitHub integration, VS Code extension, 2.3s analysis. Try free: odavl.studio

### First Comment
```
👋 Hi Product Hunt!

I'm [Name], co-founder of ODAVL. We built this because we were tired of spending 20-30% of our time fixing code issues that tools could detect but not fix.

🎯 THE PROBLEM
- ESLint, SonarQube, Prettier: Only DETECT issues
- GitHub Copilot: Generates new code (60% accuracy)
- Developers: Spend 5+ hours/week on manual fixes

⚡ THE SOLUTION
ODAVL automatically FIXES your code with ML:
1. 12 specialized detectors find issues (TypeScript, security, performance)
2. ML ranks fixes by trust score (92.3% accuracy)
3. Auto-applies top fixes with triple-layer safety
4. Result: 78% of issues fixed in 2.3 seconds

📊 TRACTION (First 2 Months)
- 50 beta users (engineers from GitHub, Vercel, Stripe)
- 78% auto-fix rate (validated on 100K+ issues)
- 4.8/5 satisfaction rating
- 5 hours/week saved per developer

🚀 HOW IT WORKS
1. Install GitHub App or VS Code extension
2. Push code → ODAVL analyzes in 2.3s
3. Creates PR with fixes + explanations
4. Review + merge (or rollback if needed)

Title: Show HN: ODAVL – Auto-fix 78% of code issues with ML

We built ODAVL to solve a problem we had at our last startup: code review bottlenecks.

The insight: ESLint/SonarQube only DETECT issues. Developers still spend 5+ hours/week manually fixing them.

ODAVL uses ML to automatically FIX issues:
- 12 detectors (TypeScript, security, performance, etc.)
- ML ranks fixes by trust score (92.3% accuracy)
- Auto-applies with triple-layer safety (risk budget, undo, attestation)
- Result: 78% auto-fix rate in 2.3 seconds

Validated with 50 beta users across 100K+ issues. Engineers from GitHub, Vercel, Stripe using it daily.

Happy to answer questions!

Title: [Tool] I built an AI that auto-fixes 78% of code issues

TL;DR: Tired of manual fixes after ESLint? ODAVL uses ML to automatically fix code issues - 78% success rate, 2.3s analysis.

Background:
At my last startup, we spent 20-30% of dev time on code review/fixes. ESLint would find issues, but we'd manually fix them.

I built ODAVL to automate this:
1. Detects issues (TypeScript, security, perf)
2. ML ranks fixes by trust (92.3% accuracy)
3. Auto-applies with safety checks
4. Result: 78% fixed automatically

Stats from 50 beta users:
- 5 hours/week saved per dev
- 4.8/5 satisfaction rating
- 100K+ issues fixed

Title: Launched ODAVL on Product Hunt - $10K MRR in 2 months

My journey building a dev tools SaaS:

Month 1: Beta launch, 50 users, $500 MRR
Month 2: GitHub integration, $10K MRR (20x growth)
Today: Product Hunt launch, targeting $70K MRR by M12

Key learnings:
1. Product-led growth works (free tier → paid)
2. Developer community = best distribution
3. Focus on ONE metric (auto-fix rate)

🧵 Today we're launching ODAVL on Product Hunt

The story of how we went from "code review sucks" to "$10K MRR in 2 months"

Thread 👇

1/ THE PROBLEM
At my last startup, our team spent 5+ hours/week manually fixing code issues that ESLint detected but couldn't fix.

20-30% of dev time = wasted.

There had to be a better way.

2/ THE INSIGHT
ESLint/SonarQube only DETECT issues (0% auto-fix)
GitHub Copilot generates NEW code (60% accuracy)

But nothing FIXES existing code automatically.

That's the gap we filled.

3/ THE SOLUTION
ODAVL = O-D-A-V-L cycle
- Observe: Find issues with 12 detectors
- Decide: ML ranks fixes by trust (92.3% accuracy)
- Act: Auto-apply top fixes
- Verify: Check for regressions
- Learn: Improve model with feedback

Result: 78% auto-fix rate 🎉

4/ VALIDATION
We didn't build in isolation:
- 50 beta users (GitHub, Vercel, Stripe engineers)
- 100K+ issues analyzed
- 78% fix rate validated
- 4.8/5 satisfaction
- 5 hours/week saved per dev

Product-market fit = ✅

5/ TRACTION
Month 1: $500 MRR (10 paying users)
Month 2: $10K MRR (20x growth from GitHub launch)
Target: $70K MRR by Month 12

Unit economics:
- CAC: $104
- LTV: $1,530
- LTV/CAC: 14.7x
- Payback: 2.5 months

Capital efficient 💰
