**Risk 2: Churn increases at scale**
- Mitigation: CSM team (2 hired), onboarding automation, NPS tracking (currently 52)

**Risk 3: Slower enterprise sales**
- Mitigation: POC program (14-day trials), references (50 customers), ROI calculator

**Risk 4: Economic downturn (budget cuts)**
- Mitigation: ROI messaging ($20K/year saved per 10 devs), seat-based pricing (scales down)

**Risk 5: Technical debt (scaling issues)**
- Mitigation: 30 engineers in Series A plan, microservices architecture, load tested to 100K users
