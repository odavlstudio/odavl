  "summary": "ODAVL website shows strong foundation with sophisticated component architecture, but key gaps in i18n coverage, missing critical assets, and opportunities for enhanced messaging clarity. Current state: builds successfully, has professional glass morphism design, comprehensive landing flow, but EN has 59 more lines than DE/AR, missing hero CTA optimization, and Features section needs benefit-focused restructuring.",
