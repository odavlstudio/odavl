# Governance & Safety

ODAVL operates under strict governance principles to ensure safe, predictable automation.

## Safety Gates

Safety gates define quality thresholds that must never be violated:

```yaml
# .odavl/gates.yml
eslint:
  deltaMax: 5  # Allow max 5 new warnings
typescript:
  deltaMax: 0  # Zero tolerance for new errors
```

## Risk Policy

The risk policy limits the scope of autonomous changes:

```yaml
# .odavl/policy.yml
autonomy:
  maxFilesTouched: 10
  maxLinesChanged: 100
  protectedPaths:
    - "src/critical/**"
    - "*.config.*"
```

## Decision Framework

ODAVL uses a structured decision framework:

1. **Observe**: Collect current metrics
2. **Decide**: Determine optimal action
3. **Act**: Execute approved changes
4. **Verify**: Validate improvements
5. **Learn**: Update decision models

## Audit Trail

Every action is logged for full traceability:

- Decision rationale
- Files modified
- Metrics before/after
- Verification results

## Override Controls

Human oversight mechanisms:

- Manual approval gates
- Emergency stop commands
- Rollback capabilities
- Audit review processes
