# ODAVL Wave 8: Governance Tightening - COMPLETE ✅

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished
Successfully implemented comprehensive governance controls for the ODAVL autonomous code quality system, completing the 8-wave development journey.

## 🛡️ Governance Features Delivered

### Policy Configuration (.odavl.policy.yml)
- **Risk Management**: Max 10 files touched, 40 lines changed per operation
- **Infrastructure Exception**: 50-line limit for .github/, tools/, and config files
- **Protected Paths**: Prevents autonomous modification of security-critical files
- **Telemetry Controls**: Minimal data collection with explicit consent

### Policy Validation (tools/policy-guard.ps1)
- **Compliance Checking**: Validates file counts, line limits, protected paths
- **Git Integration**: Analyzes diffs to enforce governance rules
- **Infrastructure Awareness**: Different limits for infrastructure vs application code
- **Violation Reporting**: Clear feedback on policy compliance status

### Enhanced Quality Gates (.odavl/gates.yml)
- **Stricter Thresholds**: Zero TypeScript errors, 1% ESLint delta
- **Security Gates**: CVE scanning, dependency audit requirements
- **Performance Gates**: Build time and package size monitoring
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive validation before autonomous action

## 📊 Validation Results
