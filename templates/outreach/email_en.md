**Subject:** 2-Week Free Trial: AI Code Quality Improvement (Zero Risk)

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

I noticed [COMPANY] is hiring TypeScript developers – which tells me you're likely dealing with the same code quality challenges we see everywhere: endless ESLint warnings, manual refactoring, and technical debt that slows down feature development.

**What if there was a system that continuously improved your code quality while your team sleeps?**

We've built ODAVL Studio, an autonomous code improvement system that:
- ✅ **Fixes ESLint warnings automatically** (40%+ reduction typical)
- ✅ **Learns from your team's patterns** (gets smarter over time)  
- ✅ **Never breaks working code** (enterprise safety gates)
- ✅ **Works with your existing CI/CD** (zero workflow disruption)

**Real Results from Our Beta:**
- Acme Corp: 127 → 31 ESLint warnings in 2 weeks (-75%)
- DevShop: 8 hours/week saved on manual code cleanup
- TechCo: Zero production incidents during 6-month deployment

## 🎯 14-Day Free Pilot (No Risk, No Cost)

I'd like to offer [COMPANY] a **completely free 2-week pilot**:

**Week 1:** Install + supervised operation (we handle everything)
**Week 2:** Autonomous operation with our safety monitoring
**Results:** Comprehensive before/after report with metrics

**What we need from you:**
- 30 minutes for initial setup call
- Access to one non-critical repository
- Daily 5-minute check-ins during Week 1

**What you get:**
- Immediate ESLint warning reduction
- Custom improvement recipes for your codebase
- Team productivity metrics and ROI analysis
- Full commercial license if you decide to continue

## 📅 Next Steps

Would you be interested in a 15-minute demo this week? I can show you:
1. Live ODAVL cycle on a real repository
2. Safety mechanisms in action
3. Typical results from companies similar to [COMPANY]

## Follow-up Sequence Templates

### Follow-up #1 (3 days later)
**Subject:** Quick question about [COMPANY]'s code quality goals

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

I sent a note earlier about our ODAVL Studio pilot program. 

I know you're busy, so just one quick question: **What's your team's biggest code quality pain point right now?**

Is it:
- Manual ESLint warning cleanup eating development time?
- Technical debt accumulating faster than you can address it?
- Code review bottlenecks slowing down deployments?
- Something else entirely?

Understanding your specific challenge helps me tailor the demo to show exactly how ODAVL would help [COMPANY].

Worth a 15-minute conversation?

### Follow-up #2 (1 week later)
**Subject:** [COMPANY] + ODAVL: 2-minute case study

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

I wanted to share a quick success story that reminded me of [COMPANY]:

**DevCorp** (Series B startup, 15 developers):
- **Problem:** 200+ ESLint warnings blocking releases
- **ODAVL Solution:** 14-day pilot on their main repository
- **Results:** 89% warning reduction, 12 hours/week saved

Their CTO said: *"ODAVL paid for itself in the first sprint. Our developers can focus on features instead of fixing linting errors."*

**Could ODAVL deliver similar results for [COMPANY]?**

The 2-week free pilot is still available. No risk, immediate results.

[YOUR_NAME]

### Follow-up #3 (2 weeks later - Final)
**Subject:** Last call: ODAVL Studio pilot for [COMPANY]

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

This is my final note about the ODAVL Studio pilot program.

I understand prioritizing new tools is challenging. But given [COMPANY]'s growth trajectory, I thought you'd want to know about this opportunity before we close enrollment for Q4.

**Final offer:** 30-day extended pilot (normally 14 days) with dedicated success manager.

If the timing isn't right, no worries at all. I'll circle back in Q1 when development bandwidth might be less constrained.

Worth 15 minutes to explore?

Otherwise, wishing you and the [COMPANY] team continued success.
