**Strategy**: Founder posts with case studies + data

**Posts (5 posts over 2 weeks)**:

1. **Monday Week 1**: Benchmark reveal
```
We spent 3 months benchmarking ODAVL against SonarQube.

Results shocked us:
→ 3.8x faster (2.3s vs 8.7s)
→ 22x less memory (180MB vs 4GB)
→ 95% cheaper ($99 vs $1,000/month)

But here's what matters most: 78% auto-fix rate.

SonarQube tells you what's wrong.
ODAVL fixes it automatically.

Full benchmark (5 real-world projects, 1.1M LOC):

```

2. **Wednesday Week 1**: Customer story
```
Our first beta user saved 10.9 hours in one week.

They had:
- 287 TypeScript errors
- 156 ESLint warnings
- 18 security vulnerabilities

ODAVL Autopilot fixed:
✅ 244 issues (78%)
✅ 6.5 seconds
✅ Zero broken builds

The remaining 68 issues required human review (as designed).

Want to join the beta? DM me.

#SelfHealingCode #Automation
```

3. **Friday Week 1**: Architecture deep dive
```
We built self-healing code using the O-D-A-V-L cycle:

Observe → Detect issues (TypeScript, ESLint, Security)
Decide → ML predicts best fix (TensorFlow.js)
Act → Apply changes (with undo snapshot)
Verify → Re-run tests (rollback if regression)
Learn → Update trust scores (continuous improvement)

Success rate: 78%
Time saved: 7+ hours/week

Technical write-up:

#MachineLearning #SoftwareArchitecture
```

4. **Tuesday Week 2**: Migration story
```
"Should we replace ESLint with ODAVL?"

Here's what we recommend:

Week 1: Run both (side-by-side)
Week 2: Enable ODAVL Autopilot
Week 3: Remove ESLint (if satisfied)

Result for beta users:
→ 19% more issues detected
→ 2.9x higher auto-fix rate
→ 6-10 hours saved per week

Migration guide (15 minutes):

3. Rewrite title (more technical, less marketing)
4. Resubmit next day at 8-10 AM PT

### If Reddit Post Gets Removed (spam filter)
1. Message moderators (explain it's OC, not spam)
2. Share more context (open-source roadmap, founder story)
3. Repost with less promotional tone

### If Traffic < 5K After Week 1
1. Double down on best-performing channel
2. Create viral content (e.g., "I replaced SonarQube with ODAVL" story)
3. Reach out to influencers (offer beta access in exchange for tweet)

### If Beta Signups < 25 After Week 1
1. Add urgency ("Only 25 spots left")
2. Highlight ROI ("Save 7+ hours/week")
3. Offer exclusive perks ("Lifetime Pro for first 50")
