### Announcement Post
```
Excited to share ODAVL Studio - a breakthrough in autonomous code quality.

Unlike traditional tools that only detect problems, ODAVL:
• Detects errors across 16+ categories
• Fixes issues autonomously with our O-D-A-V-L cycle
• Validates deployments before production

Early results from design partners:
→ 40% reduction in code review time
→ 95% fewer bugs reaching production
→ 5.3x ROI in first month

We're making code quality something that just works, not something teams constantly fight.

### Founder Story
```
After years of watching teams spend 30-40% of their time on code reviews and bug fixes, I built ODAVL Studio.

The insight: Tools that only detect problems create work. Tools that fix problems autonomously create value.

ODAVL combines:
1. ML-powered detection (Insight)
2. Autonomous fixing (Autopilot)
3. Pre-deploy validation (Guardian)

Every change is verified, reversible, and cryptographically attested.

We're not just making code quality easier - we're making it autonomous.

Launch: March 2025
Beta access: https://odavl.com/launch

[Show] ODAVL Studio - Autonomous code quality platform

Built this after frustration with tools that only detect problems without fixing them.

Features:
• ML-powered detection across 16+ categories
• Autonomous fixing with O-D-A-V-L cycle (Observe→Decide→Act→Verify→Learn)
• Cryptographic attestation for compliance
• Pre-deploy validation

Tech stack: TypeScript, TensorFlow.js, Next.js, Prisma

Open questions:
- Is "autonomous" scary for code changes?
- What languages should we support next?
- Should we open-source the detector engines?

Free tier available: [link]

Happy to answer questions!
```

### r/webdev
```
Tool that reduced our code review time by 40%

We use ODAVL Studio for automated code quality:

Before:
- 20 hours/week on code reviews
- Bugs found in production
- Tech debt piling up

After:
- 12 hours/week on reviews
- Issues caught pre-commit
- Auto-fix runs nightly
